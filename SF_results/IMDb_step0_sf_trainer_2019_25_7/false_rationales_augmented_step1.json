First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). Also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (his is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn't) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other Phatasms). Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about . The most new signs have, cracking start and, of course, Reggie B . (Possible SPOILER coming Up) To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV .

Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly . The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary . They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature . They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals . When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength . The story revolves around what will happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother . while there movie has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake . Like most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters . The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' that was very watchable and enjoyable adaption .
