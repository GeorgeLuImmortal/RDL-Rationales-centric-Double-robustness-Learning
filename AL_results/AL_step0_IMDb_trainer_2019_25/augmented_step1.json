For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels.", "Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me . I either really love them or I loathe them . Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy . Some of the smaller ones, I really loved . Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly . The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary . They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature . They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals . When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength . The story revolves around what will happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother . Although this story has overtones of incest which some would take, and's actually play a part in the story and is therefore something necessarily put in the movie for scandal's attention . With most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters . The lighting certainly nothing particularly same, both are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and enjoyable adaption .
