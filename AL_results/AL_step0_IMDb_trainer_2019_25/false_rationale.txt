"Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office Space" in that they are both films . That's where the similarity ends . We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, * praying * that it would get better . It didn't . We couldn't take it any more, and stopped the tape . Thank GOD it was a free rental . I'd have been p * * * ed if we'd actually paid for it . We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it . Now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself . I doubt it . Haiku Tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced . The movie is SO unfunny it's painful . Just mail the friggin letters already!!! The premise is asinine . The jokes are awful . We got as far as the "printer doesn't work" scene and had to stop . We couldn't take it anymore . This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth . If you are a fan of Office Space ...... don't waste your time with this turd . 0/10

Well...the movie was a [34mfun[0m [34mwatch[0m [34m.[0m The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by . Like vampires that walk in the sunlight . Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies . A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams "Ow this hurts...It's really stuck ." Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while . And there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot . Come to think of it, nothing really made sense [34m,[0m [34mbut[0m [34mi[0m [34mjust[0m got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect .

I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop . Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his [34mplaying[0m [34m.[0m [34mRex[0m Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written . William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted . Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story [34m.[0m [34mUstinov[0m [34msteals[0m [34mthe[0m [34mshow[0m, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone . The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for [34mdecades[0m [34mnow[0m [34m)[0m [34m.[0m [34mRichard[0m [34mFleischer[0m [34mhas[0m to be blamed for not directing this [34mmore[0m [34meffectively[0m, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weaker movies [34m.[0m

Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me . I either really love them or I loathe them . Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy . Some of the smaller ones, I really loved . Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly . The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary . They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature . They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals . When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength . The story revolves around what will happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother . Although this story has overtones of incest which some [34mmay[0m [34mfind[0m [34munappealing[0m [34mit[0m [34mdoes[0m actually play a part in the story and is therefore [34mnot[0m [34mjust[0m [34mplonked[0m in the movie for scandal's [34msake[0m [34m.[0m [34mLike[0m most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters .

The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very [34mwatchable[0m and [34menjoyable[0m adaption . For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels.
Stephen King movies are a funny thing with me . I either really love them or I loathe them . Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't enjoy . Some of the smaller ones, I really loved . Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly . The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary . They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature . They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals . When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength . The story revolves around what will happen with the girl . Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother .

This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it .

This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it .

He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded . The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments .

In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era [34m.[0m [34mHowever[0m [34m,[0m the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent [34mexample[0m [34m.[0m [34mMoreover[0m [34m,[0m [34mnot[0m only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction .

Great acting, and very memorable . Also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam . Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle .

I normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case . This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted . Needless to say I was brutally disappointed . Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing . First, there are gaping plot holes . Second, very few of the C-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably . Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience . [34mFourth[0m [34mand[0m most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is [34mjust[0m [34matrocious[0m [34m.[0m [34mTo[0m the films credit, it is [34mthe[0m [34monly[0m movie that I will ever [34msay[0m [34mis[0m [34mthe[0m [34mworst[0m [34mmovie[0m [34mI[0m have ever scene, and i've seen a lot .

ba ba ba boring ...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction [34mslumberness[0m . genie francis (aka [34mgeneral[0m [34mhospital[0m [34m's[0m laura) has [34ma[0m [34msmall[0m role as a reporter and that in itself should tell [34myou[0m that this movie must be bad .... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this stinker and a few others decent actors . You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this awful movie . The music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story . Even if you pay attention the plot is impossible to follow . The effects are mediocre as well and seem really dated . All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue . I could go on and on on how this is a bad movie . At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g. Avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep.

'Say Yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does . It's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers .

He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple . The plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief . The 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them .

I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies, but they should at least hire some proper actors .

If you haven't seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you haven't .
