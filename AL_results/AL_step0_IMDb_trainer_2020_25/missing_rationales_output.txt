"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless "Plan 9 from Outer Space ."

The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround it, and there's none in sight .

Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil . He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures . Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty . Maybe all will end happily after all . But alas, this movie heads straight for the toilet, with no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind .

I've seen all four of the movies in this series . Each one strays further and further from the books . This is the worst one yet . My problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it any thing other than "Love's Abiding Joy ." The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong . The entire story line is no where in the book . I find it a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is [34mnot[0m [34mcorrect[0m [34min[0m any way . The music is too loud .

This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie . For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost [34mno[0m [34mplot[0m . This applies perfectly to Redline . The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars . The acting seemed [34mforced[0m [34mand[0m [34mscripted[0m, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost [34mnonexistent[0m . I only really watched this movie to see how [34mbad[0m it was and, while it was [34mpretty[0m [34mbad[0m, it could have been [34mworse[0m . And at least it was entertaining . I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie .

This is an [34mexcellent[0m movie with a [34mstellar[0m cast and some [34mgreat[0m acting . I never tire of watching it . I especially [34mlove[0m the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together . Kevin Kline is such a [34mnatural[0m and it seems his mannerisms are [34meffortless[0m and one you would encounter often . SO its a very 'real' movie . One of the most [34mpowerful[0m scenes in the movie however, is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down . The movie also has a [34mstrong[0m message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience . Instead the actors' emotions and situations deliver an [34mimpactive[0m message that does [34mbest[0m without the use of words . And lastly, Mary McDonell is [34mbrilliant[0m as always.

Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy that I am ."

The most satisfying element about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic .

Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience .

Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedic duo .

Pat's character collides with 'Jay [34mLeno[0m's' character, a fast [34mtalking[0m [34m'[0m but down to business-player type Detroit cop .

After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together . A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing . I rated this a 9 . Lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy . Fun for all ages . I recommend it highly . (* * *)

It tries to be the epic adventure of the century . And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time .

Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere . The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other . It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well . This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message . It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view . Grady Harp

Excellent pirate entertainment!

Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever . It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years . What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue . This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains . The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material . While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands . Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again [34mand[0m [34magain[0m [34m.[0m

Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century . He is a true actor . He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles . Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary . Mary is such a [34mbeautiful[0m woman . It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying . They need each other . Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is [34mperfect[0m; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting . The Scotland scenery is [34mbeautiful[0m . The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite [34mwell[0m . If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll [34menjoy[0m Rob Roy . There is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence . And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent . One important point that makes this movie so [34mgood[0m is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes . It's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal . This is something [34mspecial[0m.

Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "Seven Pounds" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a flick which I also loved .

One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely .

When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies . I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall . The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex . While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) [34mand[0m [34mBen[0m [34m([0m [34mJames[0m [34mEarl[0m [34mJones[0m [34m)[0m [34m.[0m [34mThe[0m [34mconversations[0m between Ben and [34mSoll[0m are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry .
