Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very real, eerie cast . You're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants . Its characters are wonderful . Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn . The man created this role of badass, yet likable tough-guy . I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes . He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead . Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P .) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place . Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of \"furniture\" that comes with the apartment in which she resides . The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973 . His Bowling Orange factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the \"scoops\" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent . The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty . The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling . One final note is the ending, which even now still shocked me . It looked predictable, yet while you think about it, it's a pretty good idea .

It's still a competent thriller, the machine carried on without him perfectly, however obviously what is missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the screenplays often noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen, Dix did too . Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad . Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting who is the question . Michael Duane in his farewell film is OK if a bit of a wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments is on season in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Diane Cooke's wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie .

The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with . Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best...Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called \"The Next Big Thing\". Thing being, this magazine doesnt really exist, and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into their pop . Their close woman companion, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father . Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior . Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best . Brent is a flat ster - little lot moving him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands . Still, these characters weave a very interesting web together . And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it . Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd .

The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Ren\u8305e ck), thinking in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story . Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal ly graphic sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away . This is by far Verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to Dracula). True The Fourth Gentleman are never suited teenagers, some of the sex scenes are quite predictable (so forgive them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked . This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling .

Although when he cut out Will Smith's scheme early on, I put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when Rosario Dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable condition . Nonetheless, I still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith's and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two . One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely .

The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex . While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) amd Bill (Jones Leslie Jones). Our scenes between Ben and Henry are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry . James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in great performances as well as Hass . This movie should have gotten more notoriety . However it's on DVD and worth the money .

Patrick Boyle surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (1995).", "I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (1992). the stories seemed made in their troubled male family . In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town . Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them . The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film . Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (2000). Daniel Dante surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2002)."], "label": 1}, "18865": {"candidates": ["Dutch actress Jake took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA .
