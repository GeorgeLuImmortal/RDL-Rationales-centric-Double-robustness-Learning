I have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 [34mminute[0m [34mslot[0m [34mon[0m [34mTV[0m without any loss of plot . It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all . In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons . The heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges . Later after everything was screwed up by the evil people . The heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.
"The fallen ones" falls under the [34mwaste[0m of life (WOL) category . I am sad that I am now two hours older was not entertained . My other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy . I felt [34msorry[0m for the actors (Wagner).

The characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever . Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is .

Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films . In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to [34munwatchable[0m trash; and [34munfortunately[0m, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter . The plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc . We then get a séance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again . The plot is [34mslow[0m, [34mpainfully[0m [34mboring[0m and the film constantly feels [34mpointless[0m .

Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough . Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting . However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one . [34mThe[0m [34mmovie[0m [34mmainly[0m told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences .

It was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made [34mBeccket[0m become so called cold-hearted . Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper . Billy Zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to "put a bullet through one's heart" (as what Beccket said).

In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed into "herself" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I almost began to be really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians . Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much [34mbetter[0m than I had expected . I also was [34mfond[0m of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was [34mincredible[0m that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie . Of course I was [34mcontent[0m that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property . And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money? Finally, it was quite [34mtouching[0m that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film.

In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future . In a great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel .

Watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre . Though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky .

It was Jon Pertwee who said "It ` s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly ". Well if that ` s the case PASTY FACES is "Very easy ".

One of the most powerful scenes in the movie however, is [34mat[0m [34mthe[0m beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down .

There is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay . Lots of action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board ship!). From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here . Very enjoyable movie.

These two films are difficult to see: watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better . Great film, great actors, terrible story [34m,[0m [34mpain[0m [34mand[0m [34mcry[0m [34mguarantee[0m, but also better understanding of the others . Enjoy [34mit[0m [34m.[0m
Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap...on tv . Sometimes a miracle happens . A [34mgreat[0m film, with [34mreal[0m feelings, with [34mgreat[0m actors, with a [34mgreat[0m realisator-director . For me there are two films that everyone needs to see: the first is the Pacula? "Sophie's choice" with Meryl Streep . The second is "Journey of Hope". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living . We also have to struggle against racism and fascim . We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion . This [34mwonderful[0m film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream: Imagine all the people living live in peace . These two films are difficult to see: watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better . [34mGreat[0m film, [34mgreat[0m actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others . [34mEnjoy[0m it.

I thought this movie was very [34mwell[0m put together . The voice-overs were also [34mgreat[0m . I [34mliked[0m how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals . I [34mwould[0m [34mrecommend[0m this movie to [34manyone[0m . It was definitely [34mworth[0m [34mthe[0m time and money to watch it . Atlantis has some comic scenes that [34mmade[0m me laugh . Other scenes made me [34msad[0m . And others made me [34mglad[0m . It is a movie [34many[0m age can enjoy . From the moment Milo is the crazy "profesor" or until he gathers the crew up for the [34mfantastic[0m voyage under the sea . After I watched the movie, I read the book . It was [34mgood[0m as well, but the movie puts [34mbetter[0m pictures in your mind . It is just like the book . But go ahead and [34mwatch[0m this movie!

Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, "Seven Pounds" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a flick which I also loved . [34mRemember[0m [34mGabriele[0m Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile .
