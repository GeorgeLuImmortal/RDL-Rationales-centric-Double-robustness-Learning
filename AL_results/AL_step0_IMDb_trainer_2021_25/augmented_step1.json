Overall, i can't imagine that either extreme doses of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30 . Another problem is that the peripheral cast, those the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic value, that they fail to be relatable in any real way . However, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot . There are four elements you make here . First, beware of festival darlings . Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment . While two anonymous filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better . Yet I do easily resist but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications . In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point."], "label": 0}, "7474": {"candidates": ["This move was shown Showtime every night .

Last movies just told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences . Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he became serious . However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside .

Billy Zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to \"put a bullet through one's heart\" (as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award . Those twin heroes were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities . This same characters quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the life .

Washington Freeman director puts on a great performance . The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge . Doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there . For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down . The characters are engaging and everyone puts a a great performance and the directing is great . Mexico City feels alive, it looks like this cities, it smells like Mexico city . Everything is portrayed brilliantly . Every use under direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico City This is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch . From start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey . There enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face .
