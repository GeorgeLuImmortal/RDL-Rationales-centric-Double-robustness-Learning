The songs are pathetic, really abysmal . I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now . And the dialogue is atrocious . It's pathetic and simplistic . On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent .

Some of the smaller ones, I really loved . Sleepwalkers is one that I really do enjoy and watch it regularly . The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary . They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature . They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals . When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength .

Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title . He is uproarious, daring, and moronic . But nevertheless for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat likable character . Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the composed Alison Olsen, played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst .

Pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young . Jeff Bridges was again building \"The Dude\" bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez . But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here . \"How To Lose Friends & Alienate People\" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy . * * * Average\n",

      "Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971 . At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana . The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp . We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold . I'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Great acting \u001b[34m,\u001b[0m and very memorable . Also the directors \u001b[34muse\u001b[0m of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam \u001b[34m.\u001b[0m Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle .

This film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed . It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way . McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with . It's not even camp enough to be funny . I have yet to see \u001b[34mVan\u001b[0m \u001b[34mPelleske\u001b[0m \u001b[34mact\u001b[0m in a credible manner, and \u001b[34meven\u001b[0m \u001b[34mthe\u001b[0m \u001b[34msub-characters\u001b[0m \u001b[34mlike\u001b[0m \u001b[34mEisen\u001b[0m (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa .

Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? Learn from the mistakes of others...don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it like I did .

Well, parts of it butchered and slapped in . I can't believe how poorly this movie was done, \"borrowing\" scenes from other, much better films . One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak .

The plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief . The 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them . The 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her . The villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving . The villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries .

Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine . But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did . I mean come on, the Indian in the store . Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy . That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic . The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!!

As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we ` ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots?
